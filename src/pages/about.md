Hi I'm Jamie. and this is my little place on the internet where I write (very occasionally) about things that I find interesting.
I try to make computers do interesting things for a living.
I enjoy science fiction and fantasy, tabletop roleplaying games, photography, and lots of other things.
I'm an exported South African currently living in Dublin, Ireland.
I'm non-binary (they/them pronouns please).
